# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program for pet products. I performed ETL process, created AWS RDS database with tables in pgAdmin and extracted the dataset into a DataFrame. Next, I calculated both Vine and non-Vine reviews to determine if having a paid Vine review makes a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews.
## Result

| | Vine review  | Non-Vine review |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Total Number of Reviews | 55  | 10510  |
| The Number of 5-star Reviews | 20 | 6054 |
| Percentage 5-star Reviews | 0.36 | 0.58  |
